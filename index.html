            <h2 class="titletwo">What does this aim to do: </h2>
            
            <p>
                - Reduce environmental impacts of Building<br/><br/>
                - Be energy efficient<br/><br/>
                - Be sustainable over time<br/><br/>
                - Using materials
                All achieved without compromising health, comfort or safety of occupants inside!<br/>
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Reducing Environmental Impacts</h2>
            <p>
                - Install low energy Systems such as heating and cooling systems.<br/>
                - Increase the amount of renewable energy is being created on site. <br/>
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Energy Efficiency</h2>
            <p>
                - Done by minimising the energy consumed through passive methods like: <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Insulation. This will minimise energy loss through heat.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Windows. This can help by letting in more natural light, reducing the need for artificial light.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They can also help by providing natural ventilation and triple glazing for insulation.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Double skin facades - air in between two bits of glass which helps insulation <br/>
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Sustainability</h2>
            <p>
                - Can be achieved by utilising renewable energy methods within the building: <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Solar panels on the roof<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Providing natural vegetation. <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Using materials that are long lasting, renewable and reliable. <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Reusing materials from deconstructed buildings, and use locally sourced materials. <br/>
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Use of materials</h2>
            <p>
                - Use of specific materials can help with sustainablility <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Use recyclable materials so they can be reused. <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Use natural materials - insulation made from materials like kelp, hemp, and bamboo. <br/>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Why is it important</h2>
                <p>
                    Sustainable architecture is important because it plays a vital role in protecting the environment and optimizing resource use. 
                    By incorporating renewable materials and energy-efficient designs, it reduces carbon emissions and minimizes waste. 
                    This approach not only creates healthier indoor environments, enhancing air quality and natural light, but also promotes the well-being of occupants. 
                    Furthermore, sustainable architecture is designed to be resilient to climate change, adapting to local conditions and ecosystems. 
                    Ultimately, it balances human needs with ecological preservation, paving the way for a more sustainable future while addressing the challenges we face today.
                    <br/>

                    <h2 class="subtitle">Positive Future Impacts</h2>        
                </p>
                <p>
                The future positive impacts of sustainable architecture are wide-ranging and transformative. First, it can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of buildings, 
                leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to global efforts against climate change. Sustainable architecture also promotes energy efficiency, which 
                can lead to lower utility costs for occupants and reduced reliance on non-renewable energy sources. <br/><br/>

                Additionally, the use of sustainable materials can help conserve natural resources and protect biodiversity, fostering healthier ecosystems. Improved indoor air quality 
                and natural lighting can enhance the well-being and productivity of occupants, making living and working spaces more enjoyable.<br/><br/>

                Sustainable architecture also encourages community resilience, as buildings designed with climate adaptability in mind can withstand extreme weather events and changing 
                environmental conditions. Finally, as sustainable practices become more widespread, they can drive innovation in the construction industry, creating new jobs and economic 
                opportunities while promoting a culture of sustainability that benefits future generations.<br/>

            <p>
                Energy Efficiency:<br/><br/>

                - Use LED light bulbs and energy-efficient appliances to reduce energy consumption.<br/>
                - Seal windows and doors to prevent drafts and improve insulation.<br/><br/>
                Water Conservation:<br/><br/>

                Install low-flow faucets, showerheads, and toilets to save water.<br/>
                Collect rainwater for gardening and landscaping.<br/><br/>
                Sustainable Materials:<br/><br/>

                Choose furniture and d√©cor made from recycled or sustainably sourced materials.<br/>
                Opt for natural paints and finishes that are low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs).<br/><br/>
                Reduce, Reuse, Recycle:<br/><br/>

                Declutter by donating or repurposing items instead of throwing them away.<br/>
                Set up a recycling station at home for paper, plastics, and glass.<br/><br/>
